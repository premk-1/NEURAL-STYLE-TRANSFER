TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOL USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Here‚Äôs a clear and structured outline for building a Text Summarization Tool using Artificial Intelligence:

üìÑ Text Summarization Tool Using Artificial Intelligence
‚úÖ Project Overview:
Develop a tool that can automatically summarize long pieces of text into concise and informative summaries using AI-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

üéØ Key Objectives:
Input: Accept long text documents or articles.

Output: Generate accurate, meaningful, and grammatically correct summaries.

Support both:

Extractive Summarization: Selecting key sentences directly from the text.

Abstractive Summarization: Generating new sentences that convey the core ideas.

üõ† Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NLTK, Spacy (for preprocessing)

Scikit-learn (for extractive methods)

Transformers (for abstractive models using pre-trained models like BART, T5)

Frameworks: Hugging Face Transformers, Flask (for web app)

üìÇ Project Components:
Text Preprocessing

Tokenization

Stop-word removal

Sentence segmentation

Summarization Techniques

Extractive Summarization: Using algorithms like TextRank.

Abstractive Summarization: Using pre-trained models like:

BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer)

T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)

Model Integration

Load pre-trained summarization models.

Accept user input text and return summary.

User Interface (Optional)

Simple web app using Flask or Streamlit to input text and display summaries.

üöÄ Sample Python Implementation
üìå Extractive Summarization Example:
from gensim.summarization import summarize

text = """Your long input text here..."""

summary = summarize(text, ratio=0.3)
print("Extractive Summary:")
print(summary)
üìå Abstractive Summarization Example using Hugging Face:
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

text = """Your long input text here..."""

summary = summarizer(text, max_length=150, min_length=40, do_sample=False)
print("Abstractive Summary:")
print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
‚úÖ Deliverables:
Python notebook or script for summarization

Example input-output results

(Optional) Web-based text summarization interface

üî• Further Improvements:
Add multi-language support.

Deploy as a REST API.

Add summarization for audio or PDF files.

If you want, I can help you write the full Python code, create a notebook, or build a simple web app interface. Would you like that? üòä

üéØ Key Objectives:
Input:

Content Image (the image you want to transform)

Style Image (the artistic style you want to apply)

Output:

A new image that retains the content of the content image and the artistic style of the style image.

üõ† Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

PyTorch or TensorFlow

torchvision for pre-trained models

Matplotlib and PIL for image processing

üìÇ Project Components:
Load Images

Resize and preprocess content and style images.

Pre-trained Model

Use VGG-19 (commonly used for feature extraction in NST).

Feature Extraction

Extract content and style features from the images using the VGG-19 network.

Loss Functions

Content Loss: Measures the difference in content between the generated and content image.

Style Loss: Measures the difference in style between the generated and style image (using Gram matrices).

Optimization

Iteratively update the generated image to minimize content and style losses.

‚úÖ Deliverables:
Python notebook with full NST implementation.

Input and output image examples.

(Optional) Flask or Streamlit interface for image upload and real-time style transfer.

üî• Potential Enhancements:
Real-time NST using feedforward networks.

Deploy NST as a web service.

Support video style transfer.

If you‚Äôd like, I can:

üîß Build the full Python notebook for you.

üåê Create a simple web app to try different images.

üé• Help with video-based style transfer.
